<br />
<br />
## Summary
In the package activityT10 create a Proudcto/Product class that stores the name and the class.
<br />
Additionally, the equals and hashCode methods must be overwritten as follows:
<br />
Two products are considered the same if they have the same name and the same price.
<br />
The hashCode is calculated by adding the hash code of the name to the price of the product (remember that Strings have the hashCode method already implemented).
<br />
<br />
Add the main Store/Tienda class that, when executed, performs the following operations:
<br />
create three products, two of them with different names and prices and the third one repeating a name and price, but with different description.
<br />
Store in a single HashMap the stock of all products using the products as the key and the stock as the value to store (integer).
<br />
Show the information of all the products and stock stored (only 2 should be shown, since the third one repeats a name and price)
<br />
Add an additional product and delete a previously added product.
<br />
Show the array again.
<br /> <br />
You can modify and use this repository however you want <br /> but please refer the creator, thanks â™¥ .
